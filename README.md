## Introduction

The student performance end-to-end project leverages machine learning techniques to predict student performance based on various factors. The project involves the following key steps:

1. Data collection: Gather student performance data from reliable sources.
2. Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for model training.
3. Model training: Develop and train a machine learning model on the preprocessed data.
4. Model evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
5. Deployment: Deploy the model on both AWS and Azure cloud platforms.
6. CI/CD pipeline: Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Docker to automate the deployment process.
